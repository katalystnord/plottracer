 * **This replaces `orderByColumnMedian`, which silently deleted half a curve**
 * (found by audit, 2026-07-16; mechanism nailed down by execution after a first
 * explanation proved wrong -- see below, it is worth not re-learning).
 *
 * That function took one point per column at the median y. On a curve that
 * doubles back -- hysteresis, an unloading branch, stress-strain past the peak
 * -- a column holds pixels from BOTH branches, and one point cannot describe
 * two. Executed on a C-shape with a correct mask: `upperKept=0`, `lowerKept=6`.
 * **The entire upper branch vanished, and the output looked immaculate** -- a
 * clean 7-point curve, every point genuinely on the figure, nothing to see. A
 * plausible answer to a question nobody asked. That is the "poisoning a
 * downstream dataset" failure in its quietest form, in the feature whose whole job is
 * to spare you tracing by hand.
 *
 * **What it did NOT do, despite this comment once saying so: fabricate.**
 * `ys[mid]` is a member of the column's own pixel list, so a median can never
 * return a y outside the mask. The points-in-empty-space that the audit
 * observed were real, but they came from the *dilation* bug (see
 * FloodFillResult.mask) corrupting the very list the median then sampled --
 * near a vertical feature the dilation smeared it across neighbouring columns.
 * **Two entangled bugs, and the first diagnosis credited the wrong one.** Both
 * are fixed; the distinction is kept because "loses data" and "invents data"
 * need different defences.
 *
 * Its own header named the assumption ("works perfectly for monotonic curves —
 * the primary at-scale use case") rather than deciding it. The shape of the
 * mistake is this repo's recurring one: a **capture convenience** ("scan the
 * columns, take the middle") promoted to a **data model**.
 *
 * **We were below both references, not copying either.** WPD scans each column
 * for *blobs* and emits one point per blob
 * (`core/curve_detection/averagingWindowCore.js:52-83`), then merges only by
 * proximity in **both** x and y (`:105`), so two branches never collapse into
 * one another. Engauge keeps multiple runs per column too
 * (`src/Segment/SegmentFactory.cpp`, read for the concept only — GPL-2.0).
 * This ports WPD's model, simplified: a flood-filled segment is connected by
 * construction, so contiguity is the natural run boundary and needs no
 * equivalent of WPD's `yStep` averaging-window height.
 *
 * Output is in column order, which is NOT curve order for a doubling-back
 * curve -- see orderByNearestNeighbour, which is the other half of the fix.

 * scale (MAX_FILL_PX caps the mask, and a trace is subsampled to 500 before
 * export).

 * compares in *data* space via `connectivityFieldIndices`; pixels are isotropic
 * and the axes may not be, so this is the sounder metric for tracing.
