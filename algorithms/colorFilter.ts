/**
 * Colour filter — checkpoint 117, the foundation of v0.6 auto-extraction.
 *
 * The first stage of WebPlotDigitizer's auto-extraction pipeline
 * (region mask -> COLOUR FILTER -> binary mask -> algorithm -> points), adapted
 * rather than clean-roomed: WPD is AGPL-3.0, same as us, so we may take its shape
 * (tenets 5/8 -- take the mechanism, not the DOM param tables and `_wasRun` flags).
 *
 * WHY it earns its place beside Segment Fill: colour-filtering says "the curve is
 * the RED one", so a dashed / marker-only / crossed curve extracts in ONE run.
 * Segment Fill's flood fill needs an unbroken connected path and structurally
 * cannot do that -- and multi-series / broken-line charts are the field's
 * most-corroborated friction (ChartSense, and vectorbyte independently).
 *
 * Output is a Uint8Array mask (1 byte per pixel, 1 = selected) -- the EXACT shape
 * algorithms/segmentFill.ts's `pointsFromColumnRuns` (Averaging Window) and
 * `floodFill` (Blob Detector) already consume. So the tracing algorithms are
 * mostly wiring over code checkpoint 78 shipped; this filter is the new part.
 *
 * ⚑ Tenet 9: this RECORDS which pixels match a colour -- measured off the image,
 * not interpreted. WPD's INTERPOLATING algorithms (X-Step-with-interpolation,
 * custom independents) invent points where the curve was never drawn; they are
 * deliberately NOT in v0.6's first pass and belong downstream of the record (see
 * CLAUDE.md, MAP A's tenet-9 warning). Build the recording algorithms first.
