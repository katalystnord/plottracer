/**
 * `input` as a number, but **only if the WHOLE string is one** — else null.
 *
 * **The divergence, and why it earns itself** (found by execution 2026-07-17,
 * during what was logged as a Bar-only defect and turned out to be this):
 * upstream's `parseFloat` is a *prefix* parser, and `InputParser` only rejected
 * `NaN`. So every one of these was accepted as valid, on **all 7 axes types
 * including XY**, with nothing on screen wrong:
 *
 * | typed        | became  | isValid |
 * |--------------|---------|---------|
 * | `"1,000"`    | `1`     | true    |  ← a thousands separator. Every value 1000x wrong.
 * | `"5 kg"`     | `5`     | true    |
 * | `"1.2.3"`    | `1.2`   | true    |
 * | `"5%"`       | `5`     | true    |
 * | `"2024-01-01"`| `2024` | true    |  ← the ISO-date bug (parity gap 8b)
 * | `"2+3"`      | `2`     | true    |
 *
 * `Number()` is exactly the "whole string" parser `parseFloat` is not, so the
 * fix is to use it. Everything legitimate still passes: `"10"`, `"1e3"`,
 * `"-5"`, `" 42 "`, and any real date (`"2024/01/01"`, `"12:30"`), which the
 * date path claims *before* this runs.
 *
 * **This also closes parity gap 8b, whose stated defence was doubly wrong.**
 * It argued the ISO date was (a) *"INHERITED, NOT OURS — byte-for-byte
 * upstream's, so we are at parity and the tenet holds"* — parity with WPD is
 * not a defence for anything (tenet 5) — and (b) *"NOT a cheap fix: WPD accepts
 * equations in calibration values, so `2024-01-01` is genuinely ambiguous
 * between a date and a subtraction."* **Verified by execution: equations do NOT
 * work.** `"2+3"` yields `2`, not 5; there is no equation evaluation anywhere in
 * this file, ours or upstream. There was never anything for the `-` to be
 * ambiguous *with*. (CLAUDE.md's "value transforms are NOT unreachable —
 * equations already work" rule-out is false for the same reason.)
 *
 * **Empty string is refused explicitly**, because `Number("")` is `0` where
 * `parseFloat("")` was `NaN` — the one place a naive swap would have made
 * things worse, turning a blank field into a silent zero.
 *
 * **Known, deliberate non-change:** `"10/2"` still reads as a *date*
 * (−61848921600000), because the date path claims anything containing `/`
 * before this runs. That is WPD's documented rule, and with equations proven
 * non-functional nobody could have meant division by it. Left alone rather than
 * silently widening this fix into a date-vs-fraction decision.
