/**
 * Do this series' existing readings come from a DIFFERENT colour than the one

 *
 * ⚑⚑ TRACING A SECOND COLOUR INTO ONE SERIES IS THE COMMONEST WAY TO RUIN A
 * GROUPED BAR CHART. Every category ends up holding two readings, the table can
 * show only one of each, and the output panel explains it AFTERWARDS - once the
 * damage is done. David, having done exactly that and undone it by hand: *"new
 * colour should automatically suggest a new series."* The offer belongs at the
 * gesture, and this is the question behind it.
 *
 * ⚑ MEASURED FROM WHAT IS ALREADY RECORDED. A trace ADOPTS its colour onto the
 * series it fills, so a series' own swatch IS the colour that produced its
 * readings. No new state, and nothing to keep in sync.
 *
 * ⚑ QUIET WHERE IT SHOULD BE. An EMPTY series can take any colour. And
 * re-tracing the SAME colour after nudging the tolerance is the ordinary
 * adjust-and-look loop - a suggestion that fires there is worse than none,
 * because it teaches the user to dismiss the one that matters.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE THRESHOLD IS DELIBERATELY GENEROUS. The question is "is this a
 * different curve", not "is this the same pixel": an eyedropper landing one
 * pixel off an anti-aliased edge picks a slightly different value for what is
 * plainly the same ink, and nagging about that would be the false positive that
 * kills the feature.
